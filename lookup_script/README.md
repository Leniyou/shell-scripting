# Shell Scripting - Test
This project is a base test to check your shells scripting capabilities.

## Overview
This test will cover the most basic toolings we use in the CLI for UNIX-like based OS systems. The idea is to validate your understanding on shell scripting as well as your creativity to resolve common issues.
The test will have multiple independent requirements, each should be resolved by an independent shell script although you can share code between them, if possible.
