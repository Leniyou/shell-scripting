# Shell Scripting - Test
This project is a base test to check your shells scripting capabilities.

## Overview
This test will cover the most basic toolings we use in the CLI for UNIX-like based OS systems. The idea is to validate your understanding on shell scripting as well as your creativity to resolve common issues.
The test will have multiple independent requirements, each should be resolved by an independent shell script although you can share code between them, if possible.

### Interactive file download script
Someone lazy wants a script to download files from HTTP URLs and do some stuff with the downloaded file.

- The script should read the HTTP URL parameter, and should only recieve 1 parameter. If it reads more than one the script should exit with a message.
- The script should prompt the user where the downloaded file should be stored.
- The script should prompt th euser what file name the downloaded file should have.
- The script should prompt the user wheter he wants to: read (if .txt), modify (if .txt) or execute (if .sh or .bash) the downloaded file.
- The script should primpt the user if we wants to dowanload a new file or exit the program.
